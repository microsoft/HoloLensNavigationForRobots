Mount HoloLens on Pepper The HoloLens device can be conveniently secured to the Pepper robot's head using adhesive velcro strips. Assembly Steps: - First, access the Pepper's joint-release key which is stored under the rubber covering near the Emergency Power Off button behind the robot's neck: Use the joint-release key to remove the access-cover on the back of the robot's head by inserting it into the two holes below the cover: Make a head back strap with adhesive velcro by cutting 10-inch strips of both the hook and loop sides and sticking their adhesive sides together. Attach the strap by slipping it between the flexible fan housing and the head-cover support beam: Affix a 2.5 inch and a 3.5 inch adhesive velcro loop pad to the top of the robot's head in the positions shown: Set the HoloLens device over the robot's head and open the head-band adjust band all the way by rotating the knob all the way to the left: Secure the back of the HoloLens device to the back of the robot's head by tightly creating a closed loop with the two-sided Velcro head strap. Make a second mount strap by creating a 2.5 inch two-sided Velcro strip and securing it over the loop surface of both the HoloLens headstrap and rear mounting pad. Make a third mount strap by creating a 3.5 inch two-sided Velcro strip and securing it over the loop surface of both the HoloLens headstrap and front mounting pad and bringing over the hook side of the HoloLens headstrap to the loop side of the same strap: Pepper Configuration Pepper qicli commands can be issued via the Choregraphe application or directly using a secure shell (SSH) terminal. The Pepper robot's IP address can be obtained by tapping the button on the front of the robot's torso and underneath the bottom edge of the tablet mounted on its chest. The address will be spoken by the robot. If a new wireless network needs to be configured, in some cases a wired ethernet connection must be made to the back of the robot's head. An embedded web server in the robot provides a management website at the robot's IP address. Detailed documentation and further resources for the Pepper robot are on this website: https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-naoqi-25/pepper-documentation Install Choregraph (Optional): If desired, the Pepper robot's native programming and configuration application Choregraphe can be installed on either the Navigation or Build PC from these webpages: https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-naoqi-25-downloads-linux https://developer.softbankrobotics.com/pepper-2-5/downloads/pepper-naoqi-25-downloads-windows Tip: If Choregraph fails to start on the Navigation PC (linux), try: sudo ln -sf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libz.so /opt/'Softbank Robotics'/'Choregraphe Suite 2.5'/lib/libz.so.1 Start Pepper with autonomous life disabled If Choregraphe is available, disable the Pepper robot's autonomous life behavior: Connect to Pepper using Choregraph.

The procedure assumes that all of the previous sections' setup and configuration instructions have been completed and a 2D floor map has already been generated and installed in the system . Use the HoloLens device to perform a spatial mapping of the navigation environment. Map the floor up to at least your eye level and make sure to carefully trace along the floor edges to collect accurate readings. For visual feedback of the map as it builds, compile and run the HoloLensNavigation application and complete the spatial mesh mapping. Alternatively, compile and run the lighter weight Microsoft's Holographic spatial mapping sample at this link . Create a floor plan image from HoloLens' Spatial Map in ROS launch the HoloLensNavigation app on your HoloLens device there are different ways to launch the application. Easiest way is to use the Device Portal to launch application.
